# PetCare #

PetCare is the definitive solution for pet healthcare.

The PetCare App monitors your petâ€™s health by tracking food intake quality and quantity, physical activity, assessing health status and disease risk from immune-standardized veterinary check-in, calculating the environmental risk to which your pet is exposed, providing a daily check-in diary and awards PetFriendshipTokens  that can then be exchanged for a discount on the pet insurance plan.

The app is divided into 3 parts:

1. [mobile app](app/README.md)
2. [REST api](api/README.md)
3. [Data](data/README.md)
